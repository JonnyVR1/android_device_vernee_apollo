How to make a patches after changes in LineageOS source code:

Cd working_dir (For example: cd lineage/frameworks/base)
git status
git add .
git commit -m "name of patch"
git show HEAD > 0001_.patch

How to launch the LineageOS 14.1 build:

Download vendor and device from my GitHub.
Create dirs vernee/apollo and place them in working_dir/device and in working_dir/vendor
After copy files from downloaded device in working_dir/device , and from downloaded vendor in working_dir/vendor
Open terminal and write:

cd working_dir

export JACK_SERVER_VM_ARGUMENTS="-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -XX:+TieredCompilation -Xmx4g"

./device/vernee/apollo/patches/install.sh

. build/envsetup.sh

lunch lineage_apollo-userdebug && make bacon -j10

Wait for the build to finish, for me ~5hr
